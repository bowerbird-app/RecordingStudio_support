  # opens Google auth and the Google Picker directly from the upload page.

  # RecordingStudioAttachable::Services::ImportAttachment.call(
  #   parent_recording: recording,
  #   io: downloaded_file,
  #   filename: remote_file.name,
  #   content_type: remote_file.mime_type,
  #   # identify defaults to true; only disable it for trusted providers that
  #   # already know the file metadata is accurate.
  #   source: "google_drive",
  #   metadata: { provider: "google_drive", external_id: remote_file.id }
  # )
  #
  # Or register a browser launcher with
  # `registerUploadProviderLauncher("provider_name", launcher)` and have it
  # fetch `bootstrap_url`, open any auth popup it needs, then add normalized
  # provider selections into the shared upload queue. The queue posts to
  # `recording_attachment_imports_path(recording)` and invokes your provider's
  # `remote_importer` hook during finalization.
